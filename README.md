# Command Line Todo

This is a simple command-line todo list application written in Node.js. It allows users to manage their tasks directly from the terminal.

## Getting Started

To get started with the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mido191020/command-line-todo.git
```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd command-line-todo
```

3. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Run the application:

```bash
node app.js
```

Now the application is up and running, and you can start managing your tasks from the command line!

## Usage

The application supports the following commands:

- `list`: Lists all the tasks.
- `add [taskDescription]`: Adds a new task with the provided description.

Here's how you can use the commands:

- To list all tasks:

```bash
node app.js list
```

- To add a new task:

```bash
node app.js add "Buy groceries"
```
```

The last code block is not empty; it contains the command `node app.js add "Buy groceries"`, which demonstrates how to add a new task with the description "Buy groceries".
